THINGS TO FIX:

make it work with uneven divisions --> still some issues
make it work if multiple teams are in same spot --> couldn't reproduce issue
make it update the inputs in the DOM (this is annoying... could also hard-code sensible cities) --> kind of fixed with import functionality

THINGS TO ADD:
label for #divisions
hard coded cities
